# Joystick_diagnostics.bas
My two Tools to test and diagnose the Joystick from 20th June 1994.

With the JOYGRAPH.bas you have 4 graphs for each axis (x and y from port a and b) and you can see which button is pressed.

The JOYTEST draws diagram with x and y axis of the Joystick position and you can also see which buttons ar pressed.
